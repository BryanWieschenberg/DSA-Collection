## Python Solutions

Fully-optimized implementations for every **NeetCode 150** problem, **daily LeetCode challenges**, and **HackerRank problems**, written for clarity and efficiency.  

- Categorized by topic: `Array & Hashing`, `Two Pointers`, `Stack`, `Binary Search`, `Sliding Window`, `Linked List`, `Trees`, `Tries`, `Backtracking`, `Heap / Priority Queue`, `Graphs`, `1-D DP`, `Intervals`, `Greedy`, `Advanced Graphs`, `2-D DP`, `Bit Manipulation`, `Math & Geometry`  
- Includes LeetCode daily challenge archives and HackerRank solutions  
- Data structure utility and helper classes
- Each problem includes:
  - Clean, idiomatic Python solution  
  - Optimal time & space complexity  
  - Edge-case coverage and stress-tested logic

## C++ Implementations
Highly performant low-level data structure implementations with **safe memory management**.
- Categorized by data structure: `DynamicArray`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`, `Queue`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `BinaryTree`, `Tree`, `Trie`, `Heap`, `Graph`
- Template-based (`<>`) to support all data types
- Every class is Valgrind and AddressSanitizer-verified for memory-safe execution  
- Exception-safe constructors and RAII compliance  
- Explicit copy/move constructors and operator overloads  
- Separation of interface (`.hpp`) and implementation (`.cpp`)

## Visualization Learning Tools
ASCII-based data structure **display methods** implemented in `HELPER.py`, as well as **sorting algorithm visualizers** implemented in `sort_visualizer.py`.

- Abstract Data Structures: `Linked Lists`, `Binary Trees`, `Trees`, `Tries`, `Graphs`  
- Sorting Algorithms: `Bubble`, `Selection`, `Insertion`, `Merge`, `Quick`, `Heap`, `Counting`, `Bucket`, `Radix`, `Shell`, `Tim`, `Bitonic`, `Intro`, `Bogo`, `Gnome`, `Cocktail Shaker`, `Comb`
